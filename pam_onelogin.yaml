# Configuration file for pam-onelogin.
# Simple yaml-like syntax.
# Key: Value, where value is either true/false/string.
#
# Notes
# - String values should be without quotes, no exceptions.
# - The option 'onelogin_user_roles' should be an array of roles.
#   Each role on seperate line, specified as '- rolename'
#
# With that said, the parsing is very naive and crude, and you will
# break it if you try.
#

# Enable/disable debug/trace messages. Warnings and errors are always
# printed, both on stdout and syslog.

trace: true

# Enable/disable output on stdout/syslog.
# Note that, while having the output on stdout could be convenient, it
# becomes quite messy and isn't really suitable for anything other than
# debugging.

# Optional group to add onelogin users to. This group has to exist on the

# to the 'wheel' group and thus enable sudo for them (granted that you have
# that configured of course).

# Disable user password verification. If you decide to disable this, the user
# wont be asked fir his OneLogin password. The pam-module will directly query
# the user for its OTP-devices. This means that if a malicious user guesses a
# username, he can trigger an OTP activation for that particular user.
# ! Use with caution !

# Roles in onelogin that the user needs to have to be granted access.
# Each role should be specified on separate rows, starting with a '- ', ie. '- myrole'.

# Spaces not allowed.
